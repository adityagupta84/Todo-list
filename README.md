# 📝 To-Do List

Welcome to my **To-Do List** project! 
🎉 This is a simple and interactive web app where you can keep track of your daily tasks.
You can add, edit, and delete your tasks, and they even stay saved in your browser's local storage! It’s a handy tool to keep you organized and on top of your game. 💪

- **Add tasks** with a click of a button.
- **Edit tasks** to update your to-do list.
- **Delete tasks** when you're done with them.

Your tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so you won't lose them even if you close the page. 🙌
